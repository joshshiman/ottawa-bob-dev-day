## ⚠️ Try to build it yourself with Bob first!

Only look here if you are genuinely stuck and have already tried:

- [ ] Re-reading the [Cheat Sheet](../cheat-sheet.md)
- [ ] Asking Bob to fix the error (`"This code produces the following error: [paste error]. Please fix it."`)
- [ ] Asking your facilitator for help

**Looking at the solution too early will reduce your learning. The struggle is part of the process! 💪**

## How to use the solution

If you're using these files as a fallback, you still need to:

1. Make sure your `.env` file is set up correctly
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root folder
3. Copy the files you need into your project root folder (one level up)
4. Run `streamlit run app.py`

*Good luck — you've got this! 🚀*
